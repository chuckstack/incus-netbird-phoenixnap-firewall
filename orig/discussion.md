# Summary

The purpose of this file is to help me configure a new ubuntu server with the following:
- Netbird
- Incus
- custom nftables rules to make the server secure

## Clean State

Before anything was installed, `sudo nft list ruleset` returned and empty string.

## Netbird

Netbird was installed first. The resulting `sudo nft list ruleset` is captured in post-netbird-install.txt

## Incus

Incus was installed after netbird. The resulting `sudo nft list ruleset` is captured in post-incus-install.txt

It is important to note that incus only changes the `table inet incus` section. All other changes are from netbird.

## General nft Goals

- I want avoid modifying the sections pertaining to Netbird (`table ip filter`, `table ip mangle`, `table ip nat`) and Incus (`table inet incus`) unless absolutely necessary.
- I want to avoid making any of the netbird or incus rules more permissive.
- I create a separate table, such as `table inet chuck-stack` where we specify our rules. This separation ensures that our configurations don't interfere with those implemented by Netbird and Incus.
- I maintain my nftables configurations in a plain text file using the nftables syntax and manage it through a version control system (like `git`). This script contains all our custom rules within the `table inet chuck-stack` section.
- We apply our configuration script using the `nft -f <filename>` command. This help in maintaining a version-controlled, reproducible, and declarative setup.
